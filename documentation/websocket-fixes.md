# WebSocket Connection Fixes

This document describes the fixes implemented to resolve WebSocket connection issues in the React application.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Connection Failures (readyState: 3 - CLOSED)**
   - WebSocket connections were closing unexpectedly
   - Reconnection logic was causing race conditions

2. **Message Port Closure Error**
   - "Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received"
   - Caused by browser extensions interfering with the application

3. **Memory Leaks**
   - Event listeners and timers not properly cleaned up
   - Multiple reconnection attempts overlapping

4. **Server-Client Synchronization**
   - Inconsistent handling of connection lifecycle
   - Missing proper error handling and recovery

5. **JSON Parsing Errors (NEW)**
   - "Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position 175"
   - Multiple JSON objects concatenated together due to race conditions
   - Excessive message frequency causing queue overflow

## Implemented Solutions

### Client-Side Fixes (ProgressContext.tsx)

1. **Improved Connection Management**
   ```typescript
   - Added `isReconnecting` flag to prevent overlapping connection attempts
   - Added `isMounted` ref to prevent operations after component unmount
   - Proper cleanup of all event listeners and timers
   ```

2. **Enhanced Reconnection Logic**
   ```typescript
   - Exponential backoff with maximum delay of 30 seconds
   - Maximum of 10 reconnection attempts (increased from 5)
   - Clear connection state tracking
   ```

3. **Ping/Pong Keep-Alive**
   ```typescript
   - Client sends ping every 25 seconds
   - Server responds with pong to maintain connection
   - Automatic detection of stale connections
   ```

4. **Memory Leak Prevention**
   ```typescript
   - Proper cleanup in useEffect return function
   - Null checks before all WebSocket operations
   - Clear all intervals and timeouts on unmount
   ```

### Server-Side Fixes (websocket.py)

1. **Thread-Safe Connection Management**
   ```python
   - Added asyncio locks for connection set operations
   - Proper handling of concurrent broadcasts
   - Timeout protection for send operations
   ```

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   ```python
   - Graceful handling of disconnections
   - Proper cleanup of stale connections
   - Better logging for debugging
   ```

3. **Enhanced Keep-Alive Mechanism**
   ```python
   - Server tracks last ping time
   - Automatic disconnection of stale clients
   - Bidirectional ping/pong support
   ```

4. **JSON Parsing Error Prevention (NEW)**
   ```python
   - Message queue system with sequential processing
   - Rate limiting to prevent excessive message frequency
   - Thread-safe message handling to prevent concatenation
   - Queue size limiting to prevent memory issues
   - Unique message IDs for debugging
   ```

### Browser Extension Fix (browserExtensionFix.ts)

1. **Message Port Error Prevention**
   ```typescript
   - Patches chrome.runtime.sendMessage
   - Adds no-op callbacks to prevent unchecked errors
   - Global error handlers for runtime errors
   ```

## Testing the Fixes

### Manual Testing

1. **Check Connection Status**
   - Look for the connection indicator in the bottom-right corner
   - Green = Connected, Red = Disconnected

2. **Test Reconnection**
   - Stop the server and observe automatic reconnection attempts
   - Restart the server and verify automatic reconnection

3. **Browser Console Testing**
   ```javascript
   // Run WebSocket diagnostics
   WebSocketTester.runDiagnostics()
   ```

### Automated Testing

Use the WebSocketTester utility:

```typescript
import { WebSocketTester } from '@/utils/testWebSocket';

// Test single connection
const tester = new WebSocketTester();
const result = await tester.testConnection();
console.log(result);

// Test reconnection stability
const results = await tester.testReconnection(3);
console.log(results);
```

## Monitoring

### Client-Side Monitoring

1. **Connection Status Component**
   - Visual indicator of WebSocket connection status
   - Located at bottom-right of the screen

2. **Console Logging**
   - Connection events logged to browser console
   - Error details for debugging

### Server-Side Monitoring

1. **Status Endpoint (Enhanced)**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/ws/status
   # Returns: active_connections, has_current_progress, queue_size, queue_processor_running
   ```

2. **Server Logs**
   - Connection/disconnection events
   - Error details with timestamps
   - Message queue processing status
   - Rate limiting information

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Fails Immediately

1. Check if server is running: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
2. Verify no firewall blocking WebSocket connections
3. Check browser console for CORS errors

### Frequent Disconnections

1. Check network stability
2. Verify server resources (CPU, memory)
3. Review server logs for errors

### Message Port Errors Persist

1. Disable browser extensions temporarily
2. Try in incognito/private mode
3. Clear browser cache and cookies

### JSON Parsing Errors (NEW)

1. Check server logs for message queue status
2. Monitor the `/ws/status` endpoint for queue size
3. Verify that rate limiting is working properly
4. Look for message_id duplicates in console logs

## Performance Considerations

1. **Reconnection Attempts**
   - Limited to 10 attempts to prevent infinite loops
   - Exponential backoff reduces server load

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
   - Old progress data automatically removed

3. **Network Usage**
   - Ping/pong messages are minimal (< 50 bytes)
   - Only active progress data is transmitted
   - Rate limiting reduces unnecessary message traffic
   - Message queue prevents duplicate/redundant messages

## Future Improvements

1. **Connection Pooling**
   - Support for multiple WebSocket connections
   - Load balancing across connections

2. **Compression**
   - Enable WebSocket compression for large payloads
   - Reduce bandwidth usage

3. **Metrics Collection**
   - Track connection stability metrics
   - Monitor message latency

4. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - HTTP long-polling as fallback
   - Server-sent events (SSE) option
